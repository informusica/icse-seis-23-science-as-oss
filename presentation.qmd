# Researchers, we need to talk...{transition='slide'}

## Declare bankruptcy on papers at competitive large venues?
- Paper quality control is breaking down:
    - increasing volume and reviewer overwhelmedness;
        - getting accepted/rejected in competitive venues is more about noise than merit.
        - authors worry more about 'getting there first'/'selling the story' than facilitating collective learning.
        - we can't reasonably keep up.

## Declare bankruptcy on papers at competitive large venues?
- Replication crises with little self-correction;
- Interdisciplinary work poorly understood.

## Declare bankruptcy on papers at competitive large venues?
- Today's societal challenges need inter- and transdisciplinary insights, connecting to policy-making...
    - ...but the way in which we frame novelty and achievement poses risks to academic legitimacy.

# What if we consider the development of scientific insight like that of open-source software?{transition='slide'}

## Scientific insight as a continuously developing knowledge artifact
- Look at Git for ways to organize knowledge-building:
    - 'Main branch' for current consensus/insight;
    - Branches, pull/merge requests, conflict resolution, forks;
    - Inclusive credit with provenance.

## Scientific insight as a continuously developing knowledge artifact
- Decomposition of insight into maintainable, overseeable units:
    - Focused review and expertise requests;
    - Smaller, solid contributions can serve more complex, bigger-picture integrations.

## Scientific insight as a continuously developing knowledge artifact
- Organizational safety to find weaknesses:
    - Pro-actively search for and fix bugs, without fearing your whole application gets retracted if you find one.

# Why we submitted this to ICSE{transition='slide'}

## This community may hold some keys...
- SE best practices are your bread and butter;
- You have been progressive wrt open science;
- You seem about to reform;
- You seem conscious about connecting more to 'the real world' outside your own bubble.

## Your impact may reach beyond the software engineering domain
- Considerable momentum and enthusiasm in our junior generation!
- May the software engineering community help us in prototyping this further?

## Your impact may reach beyond the software engineering domain
- Senior colleagues, you can change _your_ system, and the winds are favorable:
    - [San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment](https://sfdora.org/);
    - [Recognition & Rewards](https://recognitionrewards.nl/) and [Research Strategy Evaluation Protocol](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/files/documenten/Domeinen/Onderzoek/SEP_2021-2027.pdf) in The Netherlands;
    - [China bans cash rewards for publishing papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00574-8);
    - [Australian Research Assessment reforms](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01611-y).
